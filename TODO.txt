📌 PRIORITY

- [] TRAIN MODEL

📌 SUGGESTIONS BY SER CHE

- [] Develop AI-driven anomaly detection for dental images:
    - Detect cavities, cracks, discoloration, gingivitis, mouth ulcers, lesions, and inflammation.
    - Highlight affected areas with markers (e.g., crosshair/green target).
    - Provide AI-driven analysis output that identifies issues clearly.
- [] Ensure the AI captures both top and bottom teeth images, including incisors.
- [] Train the AI to act like a “first doctor”—preliminary screening before the dentist.
- [] Use cellphone BACK camera for capturing mouth images → upload → AI analyzes.
- [] Implement a retake mechanism (like Shopee’s live feedback) if images are unclear.
- [] Generate suggestive outputs (e.g., “possible gingivitis,” “needs cleaning”) for:
    - Dentist (to prepare before appointment).
    - Patient (to understand condition before visiting clinic).
- [] Detect if a tooth has been extracted (“nabunutan”) and reflect that in analysis.
- [] Provide real-time or near real-time feedback where possible.
- [] Integrate with appointment scheduling:
    - Payment modes and discounts (PWD, senior citizen).
        - Allow upload of proof documents (e.g., PWD/senior ID) → automatic discount application.
- [] Ensure dentist sees patient history and AI suggestions before consultation.
- [] Decide on backend: Firebase or MongoDB (both acceptable).
- [] Implement double database setup:
    - Cloud database (Firebase/MongoDB).
    - Local backup database for offline use when internet is down.
    - Sync mechanism: transactions saved locally → auto-update to cloud once reconnected.
- [] Handle transaction errors (e.g., “transaction not completed” when internet drops).
- [] Ensure real-time syncing between local and cloud when connection resumes.

📌 Deliverables & Deadlines

- Terminal system must be ready before defense.
- At least two objectives accomplished before defense.
- Prepare a consultation form documenting progress and features.
- Prioritize hard parts first (AI detection, appointment/payment integration).
- Next week: show consultation form and progress on cleaning module.
